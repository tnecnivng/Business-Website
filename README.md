# Joie de Lashes — Single Page Website

This repository contains a minimalist, editorial-style landing page for **Joie de Lashes**, designed to run as a static site (ideal for GitHub Pages). The site highlights the studio ethos and drives visitors to book an appointment with a single, clear call-to-action.

## Structure
- `index.html` — main single-page layout with hero, services, philosophy, and booking CTA.
- `styles.css` — neutral, mobile-first styling using Playfair Display and Inter.

## Local preview
Serve the site with any static file server. For example:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Deployment
Point your static hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages) at the repository root so `index.html` is the entry point.
